# BloxSteeringWheel

BloxSteeringWheel is a little program that enables a user to translate steering wheel inputs to XBox360 controller, so that they can be handled by Roblox. Developers can add functionality for this using the [BloxSteeringWheel](https://www.roblox.com/library/12892264793/BloxSteeringWheel) Roblox module.
